# **MAG-CUPS: 5G CUPS Simulation using Open5GS, UERANSIM, FreeRadius, BNGBlaster, and ContainerLab**

**MAG-CUPS** is an open-source project designed to simulate a **5G CUPS (Centralized User Plane Separation)** network architecture. This project leverages **ContainerLab** for container-based network simulation, **Open5GS** for the 5G core network, **UERANSIM** for 5G RAN simulation, and **BNGBlaster** for simulating broadband access using **PPPoE** and **IPoE**.

## **Overview**

This project simulates a 5G mobile network with a **CUPS architecture**, where the **Control Plane** and **User Plane** are separated. The solution uses **Open5GS** for the 5G core network, **UERANSIM** for simulating the **gNB** (5G base station) and **UE** (User Equipment), and **BNGBlaster** for simulating broadband access using **PPPoE** and **IPoE** protocols.

The entire network is simulated in a containerized environment using **ContainerLab**, providing a flexible and scalable platform for deployment, testing, and experimentation with 5G CUPS networks.

## **Features**

- **5G CUPS Simulation**: Implements 5G with a separated Control Plane and User Plane.
- **Containerized Setup**: Uses **ContainerLab** to orchestrate and manage the container-based network.
- **Open5GS Core**: Supports AMF, NRF, UDM, AUSF, SMF, and UPF components.
- **UERANSIM**: Simulates **gNB** and **UE** for 5G RAN (Radio Access Network).
- **PPPoE/IPoE Simulation**: Uses **BNGBlaster** for broadband session simulation.
- **FreeRADIUS Integration**: Implements AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting).
- **Flexible Setup**: Customizable network topologies for testing different scenarios.
- **Open Source**: Ideal for research, education, and testing.

## **Components**

### **1. Nokia MAG-C**
   - **Nokia MAG-C** (Multi-Access Gateway â€“ Control Plane) manages session control, mobility, and policy enforcement for both mobile (4G/5G) and fixed broadband (PPPoE/IPoE) sessions.
   - Works alongside MAG-U (User Plane) to enable **CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation)** for scalability and flexibility.

### **2. ContainerLab**
   - **ContainerLab** deploys network components in isolated containers.
   - Simplifies network deployment and real-world simulation.
   - Used to manage containerized instances of **Open5GS**, **UERANSIM**, and **BNGBlaster**.

### **3. Open5GS**
   - Provides the **5G core network**, including **AMF, NRF, UDM, AUSF, SMF, and UPF**.
   - Configured for **CUPS** architecture with a separate **Control Plane** and **User Plane**.

### **4. UERANSIM**
   - Simulates **gNB** (5G base station) and **UE** (User Equipment).
   - Supports 5G NR (New Radio) and communication with Open5GS.

### **5. BNGBlaster**
   - Simulates **PPPoE** and **IPoE** sessions for broadband access testing.

### **6. FreeRADIUS**
   - Open-source RADIUS server for **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**.
   - Supports EAP, PAP, CHAP, and integrates with **MySQL, PostgreSQL, LDAP**.
   - Used in ISPs and telecom networks for network access control.
