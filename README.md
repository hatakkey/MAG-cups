# **MAG-CUPS: Multi-Access Gateway for Control User Plane Separation Using Open-Source Tools**

## **Objective**
- The goal of this MAG-CUPS project , build with **[ContainerLab](https://containerlab.dev/)**, is to provide an efficient, flexible environment for simulating **fixed** and **Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) CUPS** sessions using open-source test tools.It is primarily designed for functional testing and educational purposes.

## **Overview**
- MAG-CUPS is an open-source project designed to simulate a 5G mobile network with a CUPS architecture. The architecture separates the Control Plane and User Plane for scalability and flexibility. The solution uses **[Open5GS](https://open5gs.org/)**  for the 5G core network, **[FreeRADIUS](https://www.freeradius.org/)**, an open-source RADIUS server for **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**, **[UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM)** to simulate the gNB (5G base station) and UE (User Equipment),  **[BNG Blaster](https://rtbrick.github.io/bngblaster/index.html)**  for simulating broadband access with PPPoE and IPoE protocols.
- The entire network is containerized and simulated using **[ContainerLab](https://containerlab.dev/)** for providing a flexible and scalable platform for testing, experimentation, and deployment of 5G CUPS networks. 

## **Topology setup**
The topology of the setup is illustrated in the diagram below:

## **Components**
### **1. MAG-C (Control Plane)**
- MAG-C (Multi-Access Gateway â€“ Control Plane) is responsible for session control, mobility management, and policy enforcement for both mobile (4G/5G) and fixed broadband (PPPoE/IPoE) sessions.
  - This lab initiates 10 dual-stack PPPoE or 10 redundant/non redundant IPoE sessions using predefined scripts that trigger the BNG Blaster application, including ./start_pppoe_bng_notraffic.sh, ./start_pppoe_bng_traffic.sh and ./start_dhcp_bng.sh.
  - This lab initiates a single and 10 ipv4v6 5G FWA session using predefined scripts that trigger the ueransim application, including  ./start_5g_cups_10IMSI.sh , ./start_5g_cups.sh  and ./stop_5g_cups.sh  
- It works alongside MAG-U (User Plane) to implement CUPS (Control and User Plane Separation) for improved scalability,network efficiency,latency and flexibility

### **2. FreeRADIUS**
- **FreeRADIUS** is an open-source RADIUS server that provides Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA), supporting EAP, PAP, and CHAP while integrating with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and LDAP.
  - This LAB uses FreeRADIUS to authenticate PPPoE (chap), IPoE and FWA sessions and is used as offline accounting-server. 

### **3. BNGBlaster**
- **BNG Blaster** simulates fixed sessions, such as PPPoE and IPoE, for broadband access testing while also supporting data traffic generation
  - This lab offers predefined scripts to initiate fixed sessions with or without data traffic (see above).

### **4. Open5GS**
- Open5GS provides the 5G core network, including key components such as AMF, NRF, UDM,UDR, AUSF, NSSF,BSF and PCF 
  - This lab initiates the above elements using the pre-defined script:./start_open5gs.sh and ./stop_open5gs.sh

### **5. UERANSIM**
- UERANSIM simulates the gNB (5G base station) and UE (User Equipment), enabling the simulation of the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN).
  - This LAB initiates a single or 10 ipv4v6 5G FWA session(s) using pre-defined scripts: ./start_5g_cups_10IMSI.sh or ./start_5g_cups.sh and ./stop_5g_cups.sh

### LAB Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- **Docker**: Required for running containerized components.
- **ContainerLab**: For managing container-based network simulations.
- **Git**: For cloning this repository.

## Installation Steps

Follow the **[documentation](docs/installation_verification.md)** for detailed setup instructions

### **1. Clone the Repository**

- Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/htakkey/mag-cups.git
cd mag-cups
```
### **2. Create Network Bridges**
For **CentOS** (example):
```bash
[root@compute-1 scripts]# ./create_bridges-centos.sh
```

### **3. Deploy the ContainerLab**
Run the following command to deploy the simulated network:
```bash    
[root@compute-1 MAG-cups]# clab dep -t cups.clab.yml
```
### **4. Download cliscripts**
The delivered exec CLI scripts are a set of standard show commands designed to simplify session monitoring and management during lab upskilling. Rather than manually searching for specific commands, these scripts provide a convenient way to execute them. 
```bash
[root@compute-1 magc]# pwd
/root/MAG-cups/cliscripts/
```
To use them, first manually download and upload the predefined scripts from /root/MAG-cups/cliscripts/ to cf1:\scripts-md on cp-1, cp-2, up-1, up-2 and and TRA-cups. Before uploading, ensure the directory is created by running the command: file md cf1:\scripts-md on cp-1, cp-2,up-1, up-2 and TRA-cups.

## Start sessions

### **1. Register IMSI in database**
Register a 5G subscriber with specific IMSI, APN, OPC, Key, SST, and SD values using the script:

```bash
root@compute-1 scripts]# ./register_subscriber.sh 
```
You can verify the registered subscriber records using the Web GUI:
ðŸ“Œ URL: http://x.x.x.x:10000/' ðŸ“Œ **Username/Password**: admin/1423'

### **2. Start the Open5GS Core Network**

Start the 4G Core (AMF, NRF, UDM, UDR, AUSF, NSSF, BSF and PCF) using the pre-defined script.
```bash 
[root@compute-1 scripts]# ./start_open5gs.sh
```
Follow the **[documentation](docs/open5gs_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

### **3. Start the 5G FWA session**
Start the 5G session using the pre-defined script

```bash
cd scripts
start_5g_cups.sh  ## to start 1x5G session
start_5g_cups_10IMSI.sh  ## to start 10x5G sessions
```
Follow the **[documentation](docs/5G_session_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

### **4. Start the PPPoE or IPoE fixed sessions** 
Start the broadband session using the pre-defined script:

```bash 
cd scripts
./start_dhcp.sh 
./start_pppoe.sh
./start_dhcp_red.sh
```
![pppoe](images/pppoe.png)

Follow the **[documentation](docs/fixed-sessions_verification.md)** for detailed information/checking .

### **5. Troubleshooting**
The logs available for analysis are gnb.log, amf.log, nrf.log, radiusd.log, and ue1.log. You can clear these logs using the ./clear_logs.sh script.
For further troubleshooting, you can use tcpdump to capture traffic on any bridge or port. Additionally, EdgeShark can be integrated with Containerlab for more advanced packet analysis. For more information, refer to the Containerlab manual for [Wireshark integration](https://containerlab.dev/manual/wireshark/) .
